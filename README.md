According to a given task I made a decision for making SWIGGY-CLONE App
Swiggy is an online food ordering platform that uses swiggy live API to fetch the data.
It provides a similar experience to users as swiggy.
It has a responsive user-friendly interface ensuring a seamless ordering experience for customers.
 Implemented a robust search and filtering system allowing users to easily find restaurants based on location,cuisine or specific dishes.
 It is developed using ReactJs,Routing,Redux,JavaScript,Tailwindcss.
